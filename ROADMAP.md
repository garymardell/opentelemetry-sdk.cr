# Roadmap

This document represents a general set of goals for the project. It will change over time, and should be taken as a document that presents a general vision and plan for what is to come, and not as a document with specific tasks or milestones expressed. All specific goals and tasks will be found [as issues](https://github.com/wyhaines/opentelemetry-sdk.cr/issues).

- Separate the SDK from the API
- Implement key missing functionality.
